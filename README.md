# Send to OmniFocus for Google Chrome (Unofficial extension) 

This extension adds a toolbar button that opens up the OmniFocus Quick Entry window for the current tab.

* Better than the regular OmniFocus Clippings and the Service because *this extension captures both the page's URL and any text you might have selected*.
* Better that a bookmarklet because it doesn't feel awkward.

## Changelog

* **2013-05-23 (1.0)** - compatibility with pages that use a strict XHTML schema; [SemVer](http://semver.org/) compatible version number.
* **2012-04-20 (0.2)** - fixed bug with iframes appearing on the page after clicking the "Send to OmniFocus" button
